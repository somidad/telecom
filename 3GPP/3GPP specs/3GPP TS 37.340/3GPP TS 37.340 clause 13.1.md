## 13.1 Interference avoidance for in-device coexistence

IDC solution as described in TS 36.300 [2] and TS 38.300 [3] is extended to address EN-DC/NR-DC operation. For the FDM solution, the list of NR carriers or NR frequency ranges suffering from IDC problems is signalled in IDC report. For the TDM solution, a periodic pattern can be signalled per-CG in IDC report. In EN-DC, the MN can configure the UE to report FDM assistance information with affected carriers. In NR-DC, the MN can configure the UE to report FDM assistance information with affected carriers/frequency ranges and/or TDM assistance information. For both EN-DC and NR-DC, the SN can configure the UE to report FDM assistance information with affected carriers/frequency ranges and/or TDM assistance information to the SN via SRB1 or SRB3, if SRB3 is configured and the [SCG is activated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md). The network can also configure autonomous denial per-CG for the UE to solve IDC problems. The requirement on RRM/RLM/CSI measurements in different phases of IDC interference defined in TS 36.300 [2] is applicable except that for NR serving cell, the requirements in TS 38.133 [8] and TS 38.101-1 [12], TS 38.101-2 [13], TS 38.101-3 [14] apply.
