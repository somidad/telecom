## Objectives

1. To specify mechanism and procedures of L1/L2 based inter-cell mobility for mobility latency reduction
2. To specify mechanism and procedures of NR-DC with selective activation of the cell groups (at least for SCG) via L3 enhancements
3. For CHO including target MCG and target SCG in NR-DC
4. To specify CHO including target MCG and candidate SCGs for CPC/CPA in NR-DC
5. To specify RRM core requirements for the following, as necessary
6. To specify RF requirements to cover inter-frequency L1/L2-based mobility, as necessary
7. To study and specify how to reuse the IDLE/INACTIVE mode measurement results which are to be reported during and/or after RRC connection setup/resume in order to improve SCell/SCG setup delay, including:
	- Availability and validation of the IDLE/INACTIVE mode measurement results to be reported; and
	- Definition of corresponding RRM requirements; and
	- If necessary based on RAN4 outcome, definition of corresponding signalling support.
