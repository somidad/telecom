TBU

Both MN-configured and SN-configured RRM measurements are supported while the SCG is deactivated. The PSCell measurement cycle when in deactivated SCG state is configured by RRC.

When SRB3 is not configured or the SCG is deactivated, reports for measurements configured by the SN are sent on SRB1. When SRB3 is configured and SCG transmission of radio bearers is not suspended and the SCG is not deactivated, reports for measurements configured by the SN are sent on SRB3.
