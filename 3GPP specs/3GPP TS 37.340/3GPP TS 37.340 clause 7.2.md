TBU

Both MN-configured and SN-configured RRM measurements are supported while the [SCG is deactivated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md). The PSCell measurement cycle when in [deactivated SCG](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md) state is configured by RRC.

When SRB3 is not configured or the [SCG is deactivated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md), reports for measurements configured by the SN are sent on SRB1. When SRB3 is configured and SCG transmission of radio bearers is not suspended and the [SCG is not deactivated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md), reports for measurements configured by the SN are sent on SRB3.
