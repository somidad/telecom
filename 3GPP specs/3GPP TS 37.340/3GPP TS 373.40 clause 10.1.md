## 10.1 General

Similar procedures as defined under clause 10.1.2.8 (Dual Connectivity operation) in TS 36.300 [2] apply for MR-DC.

Similar CHO principles as defined in TS 36.300 [2] and TS 38.300 [3] apply for the Conditional PSCell Change and Conditional PSCell Addition in MR-DC.

Similar LTM principles as defined in TS 38.300 [3] apply for MCG LTM and SCG LTM in NR-DC. MCG LTM with SCG release and MCG LTM without SCG change are supported. LTM for simultaneous PCell and PSCell change is not supported.

Conditional PSCell Change and conditional PSCell addition are not supported for the MR-DC options NE-DC and NGEN-DC.

Subsequent CPAC is only supported for NR-DC. Coexistence of CPAC and subsequent CPAC for the same candidate SN is not supported.

Configuration of a [deactivated SCG](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md) in a conditional configuration, configuration of CPC (or subsequent CPAC) while the [SCG is deactivated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md) and [deactivated SCG](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md) while CPC (or subsequent CPAC) is configured are not supported.

In MR-DC, CHO is supported in Master Node to eNB/gNB Change procedure and Conditional Handover with Secondary Node procedure.
