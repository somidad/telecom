TBU

For RLM/BFD relaxation, network may simultaneously configure the UE to perform radio link monitoring on the SCG and beam failure detection on the SCG while [SCG is deactivated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md). In such case, UE initiates UE assistance information for the relaxation state report of RLM/BFD measurements for SCG.

For RLM/BFD relaxation, network may simultaneously configure the UE not to perform radio link monitoring on the SCG and beam failure detection on the SCG while [SCG is deactivated](../../3GPP%20features/SCG%20deactivation.md). In such case, UE assistance information for the relaxation state report of RLM/BFD measurements for SCG will not be initiated.
