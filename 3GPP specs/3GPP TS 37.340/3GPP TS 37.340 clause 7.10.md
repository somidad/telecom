## 7.10 UE assistance information

In MR-DC, the UE can be configured to report MCG specific UE assistance information if the MN is a gNB and/or SCG specific UE assistance information if the SN is a gNB, if it prefers an adjustment on the connected mode DRX parameters, the maximum aggregated bandwidth, the maximum number of secondary component carriers, the maximum number of MIMO layers, whether the UE prefers the SCG to be deactivated, the minimum scheduling offset for cross-slot scheduling cycle length, whether the UE is applying RLM/BFD measurements relaxation for power saving, and/or whether the UE is experiencing IDC problems as described in TS 36.300 [2] and TS 38.300 [3]. In these cases, it is up to the network whether to accommodate the preference or how to use the relaxation status indications or how to solve the IDC problems. SCG specific UE assistance information for power saving or IDC can be configured by the network via SRB1 or SRB3. SCG specific UE assistance information for power saving or IDC is directly transmitted to the SN via SRB3, if SRB3 is configured and the SCG is activated, otherwise UE transmits SCG specific UE assistance information for power saving or IDC in a transparent container to the MN. When network simultaneously configures the UE to perform radio link monitoring on the SCG and beam failure detection on the SCG while the SCG is deactivated, UE assistance information for the relaxation state report of RLM/BFD measurements for SCG is reported over MCG. UE can implicitly indicate a preference for NR SCG release by indicating zero number of carriers and zero aggregated maximum bandwidth in both FR1 and FR2.
