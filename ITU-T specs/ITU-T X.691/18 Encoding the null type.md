NOTE â€“ (Tutorial) The null type is essentially a place holder, with practical meaning only in the case of a choice or an optional set or sequence component. Identification of the null in a choice, or its presence as an optional element, is performed in these encoding rules without the need to have octets representing the null. Null values therefore never contribute to the octets of an encoding.

There shall be no addition to the field-list for a null value.
