NOTE – (Tutorial) This case only arises in the encoding of the value of an integer type with no lower bound. The procedure encodes the value as a [2's-complement-binary-integer](./11.4%20Encoding%20as%20a%202's-complement-binary-integer.md) into the minimum number of octets required to accommodate the encoding, and requires an explicit length encoding (typically a single octet) as specified in later procedures.

**11.8.1** This subclause (11.8) specifies a mapping from an unconstrained whole number ("n" say) into a bit-field (octet￾aligned in the ALIGNED variant), and is invoked by later clauses in this Recommendation | International Standard.

**11.8.2** The procedures of this subclause always produce the indefinite length case. ^91684b

**11.8.3** (The indefinite length case.) The value "n" shall be encoded as a [2's-complement-binary-integer](./11.4%20Encoding%20as%20a%202's-complement-binary-integer.md) in a bit-field (octet-aligned in the ALIGNED variant) with the minimum number of octets as specified in [11.4](./11.4%20Encoding%20as%20a%202's-complement-binary-integer.md), and the number of octets "len" used in the encoding is used by other clauses that reference this subclause to specify an encoding of the length.
