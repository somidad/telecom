publish-title: 11.6 Encoding of a normally small non-negative whole number
publish-path: ITU-T X.691
---


NOTE – (Tutorial) This procedure is used when encoding a non-negative whole number that is expected to be small, but whose size is potentially unlimited due to the presence of an extension marker. An example is a choice index.

**11.6.1** If the non-negative whole number, "n", is less than or equal to 63, then a single-bit bit-field shall be appended to the field-list with the bit set to 0, and "n" shall be encoded as a [non-negative-binary-integer](./11.3%20Encoding%20as%20a%20non-negative-binary-integer.md) into a 6-bit bit-field.

> Note: The following illustration is not present in the original specification.

```
bits (msb)     6            0 (lsb)
          +---+--------------+
          | 0 | value (< 64) |
          +---+--------------+
```

**11.6.2** If "n" is greater than or equal to 64, a single-bit bit-field with the bit set to 1 shall be appended to the field-list. The value "n" shall then be encoded as a [semi-constrained whole numer](./11.7%20Encoding%20of%20a%20semi-constrained%20whole%20number.md) with "lb" equal to 0 and the procedures of [11.9](./11.9%20General%20rules%20for%20encoding%20a%20length%20determinant.md) shall be invoked to add it to the field-list preceded by a [length determinant](./11.9%20General%20rules%20for%20encoding%20a%20length%20determinant.md#61afc1).

```
bits (msb)              len-1        0 (lsb)
          +---+--------+--------------+
          | 1 | length | value (> 63) |
          +---+--------+--------------+
```
