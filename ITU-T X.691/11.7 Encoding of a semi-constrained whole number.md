publish-title: 11.7 Encoding of a semi-constrained whole number
publish-path: ITU-T X.691

NOTE – (Tutorial) This procedure is used when a lower bound can be identified but not an upper bound. The encoding procedure places the offset from the lower bound into the minimum number of octets as a [non-negative-binary-integer](./11.3%20Encoding%20as%20a%20non-negative-binary-integer.md), and requires an explicit length encoding (typically a single octet) as specified in later procedures.

**11.7.1** This subclause specifies a mapping from a semi-constrained whole number into a bit-field (octet-aligned in the ALIGNED variant), and is invoked by later clauses in this Recommendation | International Standard.

**11.7.2** The procedures of this subclause (11.7) are invoked only if a semi-constrained whole number ("n" say) to be encoded is available, and the value of "lb" has been determined from the type notation (after the application of PER-visible constraints).

NOTE – A lower bound cannot be determined if `MIN` evaluates to an infinite number. For example, no lower bound can be determined for `INTEGER(MIN..MAX)`.

**11.7.3** The procedures of this subclause always produce the indefinite length case.

**11.7.4** (The indefinite length case.) The value ("n" – "lb") shall be encoded as a [non-negative-binary-integer](./11.3%20Encoding%20as%20a%20non-negative-binary-integer.md) in a bit-field (octet-aligned in the ALIGNED variant) with the minimum number of octets as specified in [11.3](./11.3%20Encoding%20as%20a%20non-negative-binary-integer.md.md.md), and the number of octets "len" used in the encoding is used by other clauses that reference this subclause to specify an encoding of the length.
