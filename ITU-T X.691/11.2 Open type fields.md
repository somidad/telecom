**11.2.1** In order to encode an open type field, the value of the actual type occupying the field shall be encoded to a field-list which shall then be converted to a complete encoding of an abstract syntax value as specified in [11.1](./11.1%20Production%20of%20the%20complete%20encoding.md) to produce an octet string of length "n" (say). ^ce0e75

**11.2.2** The field-list for the value in which the open type is to be embedded shall then have added to it (as specified in [11.9](./11.9%20General%20rules%20for%20encoding%20a%20length%20determinant.md)) an unconstrained length of "n" (in units of octets) and an associated bit-field (octet-aligned in the ALIGNED variant) containing the bits produced in [11.2.1](11.2%20Open%20type%20fields.md#ce0e75).

NOTE â€“ Where the number of octets in the open type encoding is large, the fragmentation procedures of [11.9](./11.9%20General%20rules%20for%20encoding%20a%20length%20determinant.md) will be used, and the encoding of the open type will be broken without regard to the position of the fragment boundary in the encoding of the type occupying the open type field.
